# RacketCar-Game
***A UnrealEngine4 based mobile game,only licensed dev in UnrealEngine .***  
***watch "180S race car" intro of the market : https://youtu.be/i3av8MATlqI ***   
***select release branch for full version ,alphe branch for join the dev(every idea is welcome to submit),beta branch for bug fix***   

******************************************************************************  
1.make sure you are dev under UE4.25 or upper plz.  

2.total logic under UE4.25's Virtual Scripting tool named Buleprint（BP），which may support game dev interested and designer who cant coding.even though you can add your own c++ code on your own later after you gited repository.  

3.assets only used in UnrealEngine4.

******************************************************************************  
STEPS:  

1.pick a branch and git it to your local.  

2.intstall UnrealEngine 4.25 or upper in the EpicGamesLauncher (ignore if you are already installed).  

3.then located to the procject folder ,hit the "RC.uproject" file then it will launch the start screen of the UnrealEngine which is a small image with a project name on it.  

4.wait a while after processing ends .then the editor' interface will show up .Even though you also need wait a while and have a cup of drink maybe, because it may takes a little bit longer to let the engine compile the shaders(how many left shows on the button of the screen).  

5.finally we finished the load process .          

******************************************************************************  
About Achive :  

mostly solved by the folders in the achive like: sound, character and so on.        

******************************************************************************  
PS:  

you can learn Unreal engine tech by explore the RC procjet or contribute the projcet or extend your own branch of your own after your have master the UnrealEngine BluePrint(Virtual Scripting) tech and the RC project's achive.  

many thanks to you!!!
